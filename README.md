# Simple Key Logger

Welcome to the Key Logger using pynput â€“ a simple keylogging script that demonstrates the basic functionality of capturing key presses and saving them to a log file. This Python script provides an introduction to the world of keyboard input monitoring, allowing you to explore how keys are captured and stored.

## Description

The Key Logger script showcases the concept of keylogging, a technique used to monitor and record keyboard inputs. While this script is intended for educational purposes, it's crucial to emphasize that the use of keyloggers for ***unauthorized or malicious activities is unethical and potentially illegal.***

The script utilizes the **pynput** library to listen for key presses and records them in a list. Once a specified character count is reached, the script writes the captured keys to a log file named ***logged_keys.txt***, including timestamps for each entry. This script serves as a basic example to illustrate the mechanics of keylogging without delving into the complexities of advanced techniques.

## Why Use This Script?

- **Educational Purpose:** The script serves as an educational tool to introduce users to the basics of keylogging. It's suitable for those who want to understand the foundational concepts of capturing keyboard input before exploring more advanced topics.

- **Hands-On Experience:** By running this script, you can gain hands-on experience in creating a basic keylogging mechanism and observing how keyboard inputs are tracked.

- **Simplified Demonstration:** The script offers a straightforward way to learn about keylogging without the intricate features found in commercial keyloggers or malicious software.

- **Ethical Considerations:** It's essential to stress the importance of ethical usage. Keyloggers can invade privacy and potentially violate laws if used without proper authorization. This script promotes ethical coding practices and responsible usage.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. As the script runs, it will silently capture and log the keys you press on your keyboard.
3. The script will create a log file named ***logged_keys.txt*** in the same directory as the script.
4. The log file will contain entries with timestamps indicating when each key was pressed.
5. To stop the script, press **Ctrl + C** in the terminal where the script is running.

## Dependencies

- **pynput Library:** The script utilizes the **pynput** library to monitor keyboard inputs and capture key presses.

- **Python's datetime Library:** The **datetime** library is used to add timestamps to the logged keys.

## Caution and Ethical Considerations

It's important to recognize that keylogging has legitimate and illegitimate uses. This script is meant for educational purposes and ethical demonstrations only. Unauthorized or malicious use of keyloggers is unethical and potentially illegal. Always respect privacy and obtain appropriate permissions when working with such tools.

Please use this script responsibly and in line with ethical guidelines.
